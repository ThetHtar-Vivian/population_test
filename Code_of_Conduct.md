<h1 align="center">Code of Conduct</h1>

### Purpose and Scope
<p align="justify">
This Code of Conduct sets out the expectations, standards, and values that all members of the project team agree to uphold. It applies equally to every member regardless of role or responsibility, ensuring fairness and mutual respect throughout the lifecycle of the project.
</p>

### Professional and Respectful Collaboration
<p align="justify">
All members are expected to interact with one another in a professional and respectful manner. This includes listening to different viewpoints, encouraging constructive feedback, and resolving disagreements calmly and fairly. Maintaining a supportive atmosphere allows the team to work productively and with mutual trust. Members should communicate blockers or delays early to avoid penalities and support overall team progress.
</p>

### Work Distribution
<p align="justify">
Tasks should be allocated fairly, considering each member’s skills, workload, and availability. Members are encouraged to contribute equally and support one another in completing work. This ensures that no individual is overburdened and that progress reflects the collective effort of the entire team.
</p>

### Definition of Done
<p align="justify">
 A task will only be considered “done” when it has been fully reviewed by the scrum master. This shared definition helps prevent misunderstandings, ensures consistent quality across all project deliverables.
</p>

### Commitment to Deadlines and Quality
<p align="justify">
Each member is responsible for completing assigned tasks within agreed timelines and to an acceptable standard of quality. Deadlines must be respected as they affect the progress of the whole project. If difficulties arise, members should communicate early so that the team can adjust plans and maintain overall progress. Failure to fulfill their assigned duties and responsibilities will result in a violation of the established rules.
</p>

### Consequences for violations
The following steps may be applied based on the violation:
1. **Friendly Reminder**
    * A gentle reminder from any teammate when a minor issue occurs (e.g., slightly late submission, small mistake).
    * Intended for first-time or unintentional issues.
    * Example: "Please remember to push your code before the deadline next time."

2. **Verbal/Written Warning**
    * Given if the same issue is repeated or if behavior/workflow negatively impacts the team.
    * Documented in meeting notes for transparency.
    * Covers:
        * Lateness to Meetings: more than twice without valid reason may lead to a warning.
        * Missed Meetings: unexplained absence may trigger a warning.
        * Behavioral Issues: disrespect, ignoring communication, or not following agreements may lead to a warning.

3. **Friendly Fine**
    * A symbolic penalty to maintain accountability in a lighthearted but fair way.
    * Examples:
        * Bringing snacks or drinks to the next meeting.
        * Preparing extra documentation or slides.
        * Taking an additional minor supporting task.
    * Applied in cases such as:
        * Repeated lateness to meetings.
        * Low-effort work that affects progress.
        * Minor but recurring behavior issues.

4. **Escalation for Serious or Repeated Violations**
    * Task Reassignment:
        * If a member fails to deliver a task on time, the task will be reassigned to another team member, and 0.5% per story point of the task will be deducted from the original assignee's overall contribution.
    * Mark Contribution Transfer:
        * The marks/credits for a reassigned task will be transferred to the team member who successfully completes it, ensuring that project progress is not delayed.
    * Meeting-Related Penalties:
        * Continuous lateness or unexcused absences may result in a 0.3% deduction from the member’s overall contribution, with the deducted percentage redistributed equally among the other team members.
